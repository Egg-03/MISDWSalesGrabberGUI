Read the instructions carefully and click on "GOT IT!" whenever you're ready.
This will open the actual program.


Step 2: With your main program now open, head to the "Options" menu in the upper left corner and select "Download Drivers". This will open a webpage containing Chromedrivers. Check your Chrome version to download appropriate drivers. 
More information on how to check for your Chrome version: https://help.illinoisstate.edu/technology/support-topics/device-support/software/web-browsers/what-version-of-chrome-do-i-have
In the chromedriver download page, look for a platform that matches your current system. For example, if you have a 32 bit version of Chrome for Windows, you will find win32 as your platform. Similarly, 64bit Chrome for Windows will require win64 as your platform.
After downloading the compatible version, extract it and keep it in your Downloads folder. Make sure you put in the folder shown by the "Driver Path" field in the program.


Step 3: With Step 1 and 2 completed, you are now ready to use the program. Choose your date ranges and click on the "Fetch" button to let the program do the work for you. All your files will be stored in the Downloads folder.
